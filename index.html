        <h3 class="blog-post__commentary">Before a lesson, do some research on what you'll be learning. This will help you understand the material better and make it easier to follow along during class.

        <h3 class="blog-post__commentary">Don't write down everything the teacher says. Listen and participate, then jot down the main ideas in your own words. Why write down everything word by word when you can just look it up later?

        <h2 class="blogpost__title">Stop rereading notes.</h2>
        <img src="images/Reading-scaled.jpg" alt="">
        <h3 class="blog-post__commentary">Trust me, rereading notes is a waste of time. Instead, use the Feynman technique: explain the concept in simple terms as if you were teaching it to a kid. This will help you identify gaps in your understanding and you can fill them in. If you already know the content, do practice questions. Reading stuff you already know is a waste of time.
